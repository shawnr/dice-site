We’ll step back from our immersion in digital technologies to analyze their impact, and get perspective on how to engage with and help define their future. You’ll learn the basics of creating digital media for an electronic portfolio and collaborate with fellow students. This course is a hybrid course, with most course content delivered online along with face-to-face evening classes every two weeks.</p></div><div class=course-description><h4>DICE 3010 Key Concepts in Computing</h4><p>Learn the fundamentals of how computers and programming work by exploring the building-blocks of digital technology. From the binary logic of machine code to PC architecture and networking, we’ll use simple “maker” projects and interactive media to learn through tinkering and exploration. We’ll also study the history of computing to discover the forces that have defined it both professionally and culturally. This course is a hybrid course, with most course content delivered online along with face-to-face evening classes every two weeks.</p></div><div class=course-description><h4>DICE 3020 History of Text Technologies</h4><p>Explore how humans have recorded and transmitted cultural knowledge, memory, and imagination. Learn how material culture reflects and informs values and selfhood. You’ll analyze symbolic forms like cave painting, codices, machine-made books, e-books, graphic novels, clothing, graffiti, tattoos, and digital media. Using what you’ve learned, you’ll create a project that conveys symbolic and cultural meaning. This course is a hybrid course, with most course content delivered online along with face-to-face evening classes every two weeks.</p></div><div class=course-description><h4>DICE 3030 Foundations of Digital Rhetoric</h4><p>Digital rhetoric is the study of how digital technologies shape methods of persuasion. You’ll analyze the obvious and hidden values and arguments that exist in things like video games, search engines, webpage designs, digital networks, and digital images. You’ll also produce your own rhetorically informed digital media for your e-portfolio. This course is a hybrid course, with most course content delivered online along with face-to-face evening classes every two weeks.</p></div><div class=course-description><h4>DICE 3050 Digital Cultures: Theory and Practice</h4><p>How does the study of digital cultures relate to intellectual traditions in the humanities and social sciences? You’ll become familiar with philosophical arguments underpinning current debates about digital technologies. We’ll examine how different disciplines—both traditional and emergent—describe and explain culture and technology. You’ll create an e-portfolio project that analyzes a digital phenomenon from several theoretical perspectives. This course is a hybrid course, with most course content delivered online along with face-to-face evening classes every two weeks.</p></div></div><div class=col-md-6><div class=course-description><h4>DICE 4000 Everyday Coding</h4><p>This course provides both a practical and conceptual introduction to the data structures and logical patterns of computer programming. You’ll begin by creating animation with MIT’s Scratch, a playful tool for learning how computers “think” and go on to do simple game development using Python. We’ll explore the many ways algorithmic thinking structures digital technology, allowing your understanding of code basics to take you in many different directions. This course is a hybrid course, with most course content delivered online along with face-to-face evening classes every two weeks.</p></div><div class=course-description><h4>DICE 4010 Digital Identities</h4><p>Analyze the impacts of digital technologies on notions of identity. You’ll examine how technologies constrain or open up ways of defining and representing yourself. We’ll cover topics like anonymous online discussion, video game avatars, digital counterpublics, and the quantified self. In a final project, you will collaboratively construct an identity and then analyze its form and possible meanings. This course is a hybrid course, with most course content delivered online along with face-to-face evening classes every two weeks.</p></div><div class=course-description><h4>DICE 4020 Global Digital Cultures</h4><p>This course asks questions about the roles of digital technology in the process of globalization. You’ll examine the possibilities and limits of new technologies to reproduce and disrupt culture, focusing on how specific technologies perpetuate and/or disrupt local and global markets, nationalist identity, and cultural reproduction. Topics include globalization, cultural imperialism, micro-lending, national firewalls, digital witnessing, “right to be forgotten” laws, digital propaganda, and global activism. You’ll present a case study about a specific use of digital technology in a global context. This course is a hybrid course, with most course content delivered online along with face-to-face evening classes every two weeks.</p></div><div class=course-description><h4>DICE 4030 Multimodal Composition</h4><p>Explore how high-bandwidth connectivity and mobile devices have allowed images, video, animation, and data visualization to become part of our everyday media landscape. We’ll look at how the ability to interact with and create our own media has transformed media flows from a broadcasting model to a “many-to-many” ecosystem. You’ll learn the basics of digital media design and production, creating original multimodal projects for your e-portfolio. This course is a hybrid course, with most course content delivered online along with face-to-face evening classes every two weeks.</p></div><div class=course-description><h4>DICE 4040 Social Justice and Digital Media</h4><p>Investigate how various power structures (political, institutional, local, and global) have used digital technologies to assert and maintain authority.
